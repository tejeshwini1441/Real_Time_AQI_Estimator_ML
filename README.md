# Air Quality Index Estimation using Machine Learning

The **Air Quality Prediction** project is a machine learning initiative designed to forecast air pollution levels for a specific region by analyzing historical air quality and environmental data. This project is aimed at supporting public health awareness, government policy, and early warning systems through accurate, data-driven air quality estimation.

## Title

**Air Quality Index Estimation using Machine Learning**

## Summary

This project addresses the growing global concern around air pollution and its adverse effects on human health, climate, and the environment. By applying machine learning techniques to historical dataâ€”including pollutant concentrations and meteorological variablesâ€”the model aims to predict air quality levels for specific regions in real or near-real time.

## Objective

The core objective is to develop a reliable and scalable machine learning model that can estimate air quality indices such as:

- PM2.5 (Fine Particulate Matter)
- PM10 (Inhalable Particles)
- NOâ‚‚ (Nitrogen Dioxide)
- SOâ‚‚ (Sulfur Dioxide)
- Oâ‚ƒ (Ozone)

The predictions aim to support:

- Public health alerts
- Government environmental planning
- General awareness and community decision-making

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Sourced from official air quality monitoring stations, meteorological datasets, and traffic data.
   - Includes pollutant concentration levels and relevant environmental variables.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing or inconsistent entries.
   - Data normalization, encoding, and time-series formatting where applicable.

3. **Feature Engineering & Selection**  
   - Extraction of relevant features affecting AQI.
   - Removal of redundant or non-informative variables.

4. **Model Selection**  
   - Evaluation of algorithms including:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Tree Regressor
     - Random Forest Regressor
     - Gradient Boosting Regressor
     - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

5. **Model Training**  
   - Dataset split into training and testing subsets.
   - Models trained using cross-validation techniques.

6. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Metrics used:
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
     - R-squared (RÂ² Score)

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Optimization using grid search and/or randomized search for best model performance.

8. **Prediction and Deployment**  
   - Final model used for forecasting air quality.
   - Ready for integration into real-time dashboards or mobile applications.
     
## Expected Outcomes

1. **High-Accuracy Predictions**  
   The trained model is expected to deliver reliable AQI forecasts under varying environmental conditions.

2. **Public Health Contribution**  
   Raises awareness and helps individuals make better health and travel decisions.

3. **Policy Support & Decision-Making**  
   Enables environmental authorities to make proactive, data-backed decisions.

4. **Early Warning System Integration**  
   The model can be extended to alert systems for areas with critical pollution spikes.
